      <h1>Semantic Naming</h1> 
      <p>
        It's often the case that when working through a project you come to realize that the gradient background for the home button is also the same for the submit buttons. Refactoring gives you the chance to rename these functions in a more meaningful (or possibly more abstract yet applicable) way.
      </p>
      <p>
        taking the time to consider the semantic meaning of your dom elements can not only help give your pages more structure it can also help in your styling. This comes in to play heavily when it comes to refactoring with a designer. Your Designer is likely to have set aside specific styles for headings and key points of interest, this is based around the content of the site, if your css mirrors this idea of following the content then it's structure should fall naturally in line with that of the design.
